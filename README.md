# The Pathfinding Project

üî° Status: Functional, mostly

‚ùó This is meant to be injected in MC Forge 1.8.9!

ü§î The purpose of this project is to develop a Minecraft external cheat that can do all sorts of pathfinding.

‚úîÔ∏è Trello roadmap: https://trello.com/b/ifrJZSCx/the-pathfinding-project

# How to use

‚ùó When injecting, make sure you are in a world.

üß∞ Available console commands:
  1. goto
  2. makepath
  3. print
  4. send
  5. end

## 1. goto

Pathfind from your location to the specified coordinates.

If mid-air, the starting location is the first block below you.

The target must be a solid block.

Does not check for invalid block names!

```
goto x y z (flags)

x, y, z = coordinates to pathfind to
```

Flags:
```
+safe
Attempts to fix any problems regarding the start & target's Y level.
Use if pathfinding is failing.

+setblock blockName
Will make the path out of the block specified in blockName.
```

Example:
```
goto 12 65 -33 +safe +setblock redstone_block
  // With safety flag
goto 104 35 90 +setblock stone
  // Without safety flag
```

## 2. makepath

Pathfind from a location to another location.

Both locations must be solid blocks.

Does not check for invalid block names!

```
makepath x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 (flags)
x1, y1, z1 = coordinates of the starting location
x2, y2, z2 = coordinates of the target location
```

Flags:
```
+safe
Attempts to fix any problems regarding the start & target's Y level.
Use if pathfinding is failing.

+setblock blockName
Will make the path out of the block specified in blockName.
```

Example:
```
makepath -10 3 20 50 12 45  +safe +setblock stone
  // Will make a path from (-10, 3, 20) to (50, 12, 45) out of stone
```

## 3. print

Shows your input as an in-game message only you can see.

```
print message
(optional) message = the string which will be displayed in-game
```

Example:
```
print hey mom
  // Will show the message "hey mom" in your chat
```

## 4. send

Sends a message from the player.

```
send message
(optional) message = the string which will be sent in chat
```

Example:
```
send Hi guys!
  // Will send "Hi guys!" in chat.
```

## 5. end

Ends the execution of the DLL.

```
end
```
