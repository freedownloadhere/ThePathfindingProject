# The Pathfinding Project (Not functional yet!!)

This is meant to be injected in MC Forge 1.8.9!

The purpose of this project is to develop a Minecraft external cheat that can do all sorts of pathfinding.
Currently the pathfinding code has not yet been copy-pasted from my other repo.

# Goals:

- 2D pathfinding
- 3D pathfinding
- Smart pathfinding (Be able to jump, go through gaps etc)
- Create and traverse a path automatically
